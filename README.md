## Learning Styling with SCSS

This project is a collection of small components and features created to practice and explore SCSS styling techniques. It includes a basic to-do list and a movies API integration, with the primary focus on experimenting with SCSS features like variables, mixins, nesting, and responsive design.

Note:

- This is not a cohesive app; the features are intentionally mixed for learning purposes.
- The to-do list and movies list are separate components and not fully developed features.
- The focus is entirely on styling, so some functionality may be minimal or incomplete.
